1. please am having a problem implementing part 4 and 5 for the project i.e (virtal host and Enabling Php)

 
2.on step 5 the phpinfo page didnt come up when i inputted my public ip address and port 80
 

 3.  i was unable to see the echo message `sudo echo 'Hello LAMP from hostname' $(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-hostname) '197.211.58.19' $(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4) > /var/www/projectlamp/index.html` from the  step four  from the brower


PLease i would really apperciate some insight into this in the project review
